# Rust Training Ground

Things I want to learn:

- [x] The basics of Rust (in progress...)
- [ ] What I can do with Rust
- [ ] Sex On the Beach

## Considerable Applications

Ways I may use rust in the near term:

- Hardware programming

### Running locally

You can hit `F5` to run the `main.rs` entrypoint

This is still a playground so it's useless to actually build anything.

However, because this is using an unstable `2021` version of rust, you'll need to use:

- `cargo +nightly build` to generate an unoptimized build
- `cargo +nightly build --release` to generate an optimized production build

Regardless, it's a playground.
